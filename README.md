# Web browser for DPCfam project 

Web application to provide basic navigation tools to query the DPCfam dataset.
The app was developed using the content manager ProcessWire and MySQL (with InnoDB engine).
Latest version supports querying the system using MCs, Pfam families or UniProt ids.

The webpage is currently currently online at: [dpcfam.areasciencepark.it](dpcfam.areasciencepark.it)


### TODO:

- add datatable to metacluster.php
- modify protein plots (allow to enable/disable domains)
- make search bar input more flexible (MC1,MC2,MC3 == MC1, MC2, MC3)
- make top right bar accept any input (MC, prot, pfam)
- long-term: improve speed of protein search
